<h1>Image and Text</h1>
<p>The example on this page shows image and text arranged in two columns</p>

<!-- 
COMMENTS: The code below is for a two column layout with image on the left and text on the right.
The page is divided into 12 possible units. So in this example, the left column is 5 units wide and the right column is 7 units wide. This is done using the col-sm-5 and col-sm-7, which you can see below. 
If you want the image column and text column to be equal widths, change both col-sm entries to col-sm-6 each. You can try different numbers as long as the two numbers are equal to 12.
